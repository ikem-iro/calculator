The script.js file is OOP and contains a class called Calculator that handles all the calculator logic and the index.js file is functional programming and contains functions that handles all the logic of the calculator.

By default, in the index.html file, the script tag has a source that points to script.js. If you wish to use the functional program, change the source to point to the index.js.

Have fun modding and playing around with the functions or adding new functionality.
